[1] Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning [online](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Brml.HomePage)


Graphical Models are a marriage between Graph and Probability Theory. 
They enable the unification of many algorithms and models in a diverse range of fields, providing a clean and consistent framework 
for dealing with uncertainty. The course will deal theoretical aspects of inference and learning, applying these techniques to 
concrete examples in machine learning, information processing and statistics.
