__________________________

The module is about prediction and control using reinforcement learning, including aspects of deep reinforcement learning, i.e., the application of neural networks-based functional approximation to reinforcement learning problems.The moldule covers the following topics:

1. Markov decision processes
2. Planning by dynamic programming
3. Model-free prediction and control
4. Value function approximation
5. Policy gradient methods, Actor-critic algorithms
6. Integration of Learning and Planning
7. Exploration vs exploitation trade-offs
