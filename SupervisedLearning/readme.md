### Supervised Learning

The course consists of both foundational topics for supervised learning such as Linear Regression, Nearest Neighbours and Kernelisation as well contemporary research areas such as multi-task learning and optimisation via proximal methods. In a given year topics will be drawn non-exclusively from the following:

    Nearest Neighbours;
    Linear Regression;
    Kernels and Regularisation;
    Support Vector Machines;
    Gaussian Processes;
    Decision Trees;
    Ensemble Learning;
    Sparsity Methods;
    Multi-task Learning;
    Proximal Methods;
    Semi-supervised Learning;
    Neural Networks;
    Matrix Factorization;
    Online Learning;
    Statistical Learning Theory.
