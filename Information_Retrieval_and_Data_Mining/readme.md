Assignments 1 and 2 consitute two parts of a project on Passage Ranking Algorithms, encompassing a literature review, an implementation from scratch of basic algorithms such as BM25 and implementation of more sophisticated models, such as LAMBDAMart.
________
Content of the module:

Overview of the fields:
Study some basic concepts of information retrieval and data mining, such as the concept of relevance, association rules, and knowledge discovery. Understand the conceptual models of an information retrieval and knowledge discovery system.

Indexing and Text Processing:
Introduce various indexing techniques for textual information items, such as inverted indices, tokenization, stemming and stop words. Techniques used for text compression, such as the Lempel-ziv algorithm and Huffman Coding will be covered.

Retrieval Methods:
Study popular retrieval models (boolean, vector space, binary independence, language modelling). Probability ranking principle. Other commonly-used techniques such as relevance feedback, pseudo relevance feedback, and query expansion will also be covered;

Measurements:
Online and offline Evaluation techniques to evaluate retrieval quality. Commonly used evaluation metrics such as average precision, NDCG, etc. Cranfield Paradigm and TREC conferences, as well as some recently popular techniques such as interleaving will be discussed;

Data Mining:
Study basic techniques, algorithms, and systems of data mining and analytics, including frequent pattern and correlation and association analysis, basic machine learning algorithms such as linear regression and logistic regression. Discussion on basic personalisation and usage mining techniques.

Emerging Areas:
Study new emerging areas such as learning to rank, deep learning, word embeddings and topic modelling.
